# Tkinter-Minesweeper
Minesweeper game made by the tkinter/customtkinter framework

Customtkinter at the moment doesn't have bind functionality for its button so I had to modify its source code to be able to tag mines in the game, that's why it's included with the source code.
Check out customtkinter [here](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter)

## Installation
Simply download and run the setup file.

## Showcase

The application adapts to the theme of the OS used thanks to customtkinter. Here's an example for Light mode:
